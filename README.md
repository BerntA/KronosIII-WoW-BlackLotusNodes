# Kronos III Vanilla WoW Black Lotus Nodes
Tired of looking online for spawn points? Use this pre-generated gatherer file for all the nodes...

# Prerequisites
* Gatherer : https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/gatherer/

# Installation
Locate your WoW install folder, go to the WTF/Account/<Account Login Name>/SavedVariables/Gatherer.lua,
the script in this code will generate a .lua file which represents the Gatherer nodes for Black Lotus in all available zones for Kronos III.
Simply copy the stuff directly into your GatherItems area in the Gatherer.lua file, be sure to paste it into the right section... (continent + zone)
